Because this year was our 50th wedding anniversary, we got to pick the venue. Knowing how pictures can &quot;lie,&quot; I visited at least two dozen hotels around Union Square in San Francisco and was delighted that the Donatello was within our price range. The standard rooms are larger than any others in the nearby hotels--and the windows open, a real plus for me. From booking through checkout, service from everyone was friendly and efficient. The rooms are equipped with a microwave, fridge, and basic dishware. Friday afternoon wine and cheese was augumented during our stay with appetizers from a local restaurant; we had an enjoyable hour socializing with other guests. The free continental breakfast (which apparently was not everyone's favorite) has been replaced by a self-serve buffet ($7/person added to your bill) at the Zingari restaurant bar (accessible by hotel elevator). I'm unclear about the relationship between the restaurant and the hotel, but would recommend the restaurant as well. My husband and I have eaten there many times and never had less than good to excellent food and service. This time they were even willing to provide us with separate checks (a must at these reunions).We had rooms on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors and had no complaints about noise. Our rooms faced Mason St.; rooms facing Post might be noisier. The hotel is in the center of a major city, after all, so it's not going to be as quiet as a wilderness.The hotel is a resort, but I asked that we not be given a sales pitch. That was not our purpose for getting together.

The thing that bug me the most was the day prior to leaving I asked if they could CALL me a taxi to take me to the airport the next morning. So the next morning I check out and I realize that they did not call a taxi for me but they scheduled an employee to take me to the airport with his filthy car and charge 50$ cash ( that's illegal by the way in SFO ). So I had to call a REAL taxi driver to take me to the airport and it cost me 40$ instead, and the cab was clean. Other than that if you're only looking for a place to stay for a night it's not too bad has long as you take care of calling a taxi yourself.

The location is superb - very safe compared to just a few blocks further down the road (I had friends staying on 7th St off Market and the difference was marked) and also within walking distance of just about everything you'll need. The service was exceptional (I also stayed at the Whitcomb - avoid! - and the Hilton - so, so) and the little touches, like the free muffins and coffee for breakfast, very welcome.

At the afternoon reception, the cheese wasn't put out till halfway through. The white wine was no match for the warmth in the common area. At breakfast the next morning, the quiches were not even remotely warm, much less hot.

The rooms are nicely decorated and a good size compared to other hotel rooms in San Francisco. The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning system, but not a problem as long as you dont go during a heatwave. Our toilet leaked a bit, but we figured out that all we needed to do was jiggle the handle. the weahter forecast was left on the bed each noght with some chocolates during the turndown service which I considered to be a nice touch. Staff was friendly and courteous, always eager to answer a question or engage in conversation if you had the time. Price was great. Walgreens accross the street was super convenient. We tried finding cheaper parking in the area, but other garages seemed a bit shady, especially when you can smell alcohol on the attendents breath. So we decided to go with the valet parking at the hotel for $35 a day with in and out priveledges. The location was amazing. We were able to walk to the beginning of the cable car line at powell and market st in just a few minutes (5 blocks). I recommend starting there, otherwise you might get passed up at other cable car stops because there is simply no room for you. There is also a subway at that same intersection. Buy a muni pass!. you can use almost every kind of transportation at leisure for unlimited rides. there are other tour busses that charge an arm and a leg to drop you off at all the tourist spots. with a muni pass, all you need is a map of the city to see what lines you need to catch. Super convenient for out trips to fishermans wharf and the ball park. We skipped the transportation for our trips to Yerba Buena Gardens, union square and chinatown.

As we were always out sightseeing or visiting various bars or restaurants we spent little time in our rooms to be affected by any noise. There isnt a restaurant in the hotel but who wants to eat hotel food when there are so many cafes, restaurants and bars around? A small shop opened whilst we were there where you could get croissants, coffee etc if you didnt want to look around for food. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its location, cleanliness and value for money. Also if you want to do some sightseeing try the Gocar, its like a go cart with an engine and has sat nav which takes you all around san fransisco, the beaches and some beautiful parks and lakes too.

We also liked its literary slant and the adjoining Cafe Andree next door (very nice pancakes and coffee for breakfast!)The bedroom was on the small side with crooked floors, but also bright - quite Parisien in feel.

Because this year was our 50th wedding anniversary, we got to pick the venue. Knowing how pictures can &quot;lie,&quot; I visited at least two dozen hotels around Union Square in San Francisco and was delighted that the Donatello was within our price range. The standard rooms are larger than any others in the nearby hotels--and the windows open, a real plus for me. From booking through checkout, service from everyone was friendly and efficient. The rooms are equipped with a microwave, fridge, and basic dishware. Friday afternoon wine and cheese was augumented during our stay with appetizers from a local restaurant; we had an enjoyable hour socializing with other guests. The free continental breakfast (which apparently was not everyone's favorite) has been replaced by a self-serve buffet ($7/person added to your bill) at the Zingari restaurant bar (accessible by hotel elevator). I'm unclear about the relationship between the restaurant and the hotel, but would recommend the restaurant as well. My husband and I have eaten there many times and never had less than good to excellent food and service. This time they were even willing to provide us with separate checks (a must at these reunions).We had rooms on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors and had no complaints about noise. Our rooms faced Mason St.; rooms facing Post might be noisier. The hotel is in the center of a major city, after all, so it's not going to be as quiet as a wilderness.The hotel is a resort, but I asked that we not be given a sales pitch. That was not our purpose for getting together.

The thing that bug me the most was the day prior to leaving I asked if they could CALL me a taxi to take me to the airport the next morning. So the next morning I check out and I realize that they did not call a taxi for me but they scheduled an employee to take me to the airport with his filthy car and charge 50$ cash ( that's illegal by the way in SFO ). So I had to call a REAL taxi driver to take me to the airport and it cost me 40$ instead, and the cab was clean. Other than that if you're only looking for a place to stay for a night it's not too bad has long as you take care of calling a taxi yourself.

The location is superb - very safe compared to just a few blocks further down the road (I had friends staying on 7th St off Market and the difference was marked) and also within walking distance of just about everything you'll need. The service was exceptional (I also stayed at the Whitcomb - avoid! - and the Hilton - so, so) and the little touches, like the free muffins and coffee for breakfast, very welcome.

At the afternoon reception, the cheese wasn't put out till halfway through. The white wine was no match for the warmth in the common area. At breakfast the next morning, the quiches were not even remotely warm, much less hot.

The rooms are nicely decorated and a good size compared to other hotel rooms in San Francisco. The only drawback is that there is no air conditioning system, but not a problem as long as you dont go during a heatwave. Our toilet leaked a bit, but we figured out that all we needed to do was jiggle the handle. the weahter forecast was left on the bed each noght with some chocolates during the turndown service which I considered to be a nice touch. Staff was friendly and courteous, always eager to answer a question or engage in conversation if you had the time. Price was great. Walgreens accross the street was super convenient. We tried finding cheaper parking in the area, but other garages seemed a bit shady, especially when you can smell alcohol on the attendents breath. So we decided to go with the valet parking at the hotel for $35 a day with in and out priveledges. The location was amazing. We were able to walk to the beginning of the cable car line at powell and market st in just a few minutes (5 blocks). I recommend starting there, otherwise you might get passed up at other cable car stops because there is simply no room for you. There is also a subway at that same intersection. Buy a muni pass!. you can use almost every kind of transportation at leisure for unlimited rides. there are other tour busses that charge an arm and a leg to drop you off at all the tourist spots. with a muni pass, all you need is a map of the city to see what lines you need to catch. Super convenient for out trips to fishermans wharf and the ball park. We skipped the transportation for our trips to Yerba Buena Gardens, union square and chinatown.

As we were always out sightseeing or visiting various bars or restaurants we spent little time in our rooms to be affected by any noise. There isnt a restaurant in the hotel but who wants to eat hotel food when there are so many cafes, restaurants and bars around? A small shop opened whilst we were there where you could get croissants, coffee etc if you didnt want to look around for food. I would definitely recommend this hotel for its location, cleanliness and value for money. Also if you want to do some sightseeing try the Gocar, its like a go cart with an engine and has sat nav which takes you all around san fransisco, the beaches and some beautiful parks and lakes too.
